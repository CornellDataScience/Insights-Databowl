*Objective*: Determine how many yards will an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff. Perhaps, we can try to answer additional questions in the future.

*Goals*: Develop statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays. Visualize how our models work and the outcome of each play. Simulate, analyze, and visualize live data. Input data for any play and visualize the outcome.

*Past work done*: Data compilation and some cleaning

*Milestones*: 
1. Get familiar with dataset, data cleaning
1. Get visualization of plays working (essential dynamics)
1. Work on simple models â€” simple regression, basic machine learning techniques. Feature engineering
1. Set baseline accuracy for future models
1. Cool models. Neural nets, advanced machine learning, statistical modeling
1. Visualize the model, upgrade visualization of plays
1. Live data simulation, analysis, visualization
1. Input data for any plan and visualize the outcome
